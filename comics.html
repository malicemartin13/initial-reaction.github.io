		She reluctantly answers (I don't know, good. I guess.) After scratching the back of her head, she reaches 
		out her hand and makes a suggestion. (Here, give me your phone) She says. The comic ends with the man saying 
		(What are you doing?) as he looks over his coworker's shoulder. She types on his phone and says, 
		(Calling him. So you can ask him yourself.)">
