## Welcome to rosieilene.com, brought to you by GitHub Pages

Everyday, my twin site [malicealicemartin.com](http://malicealicemartin.com) will be hiding in a new place throughout this site. Once you find it, click to view more uncensored material. Although NSFW, you will find lots of artistic expression that will keep you here for hours. Are you ready to step into a bizarre world of animated imagination?


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/malicemartin13/initial-reaction.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/malicemartin13/initial-reaction.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
