			<h2>...the place where I keep my comics.</h2>

			<p>And how I carry myself.</p>
			<p>Yes, I give it everything I've got when I write the dialogue meant to connect you from the real world to the fantasy painstakingly designed to ground your
			sanity. Every panel was created to make you feel something while going on a written journey.</p>
			<p>This is the vulernable space I have given myself for self-expression and it is an honor to have you as my guest. Thank you for being with Malice
			Alice Martin in the past and thank for you staying as we grow together and inspire each other to keep our creative motivation alive. This world, and if you
			live in The United States like I do, is unkind to its artists. Expecting so much from us while giving so little in return.</p>
			<p>There are plenty of people out there who can come up with better examples than I can. Even those who don't consider themselves "making it through the filter."</p>
			<p>I didn't think I'd ever come this far. Going against all odds and making my comics/artwork visible for millions of people. I was hesitant for a while. Because 
			the discouragement worked.</p>
			<p>Up until now.</p>
			<p>Even though I have my doubts from time to time.</p>
