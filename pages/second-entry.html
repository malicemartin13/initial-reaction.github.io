			<h2>My Message for 2017: Listen to Bernie Sanders.</h2>
			<h3>Protect each other. Keep each other safe.</h3>
				<p>January 20th, 2017</p>
				<p>This card was written around Christmas time, all finished in one go. As I sat in the comfort of my work office in a cushioned black chair,
				I bowed by head down and looked at this blank card I placed on the table in front of me. I imagined what words were going to  
				permenantly go on this card. Then, I took a deep breath and wrote, choosing Prismacolor bright orange brush pen as the color. As 
				terrible as I am with expressing myself, that didn't stop me from writing. I just let it all out. One take, all from the heart.</p>
				<p>"But Rosie! What if you make a mistake and write the wrong word? Y'know, Instead of the one you would have written if you hadn't 
				second-guessed yourself like you always do?" Well, then I'm just gonna have to make it work. Maybe that was an attempt to change my mindset.
				In order to do so, we all have to start off small and go at our own pace, <i>y'know</i>?</p>
				
				<p>Even though I was just arguing with myself in my head, I could see that she was right. This one could have been more powerful if I had written 
				this word instead of that one...but it's already on paper and people can see it. Good. I want them to see it. I want them to know where I stand.</p>
				<p>And who I support.</p>
				
				<p>There are no "could-haves" now. That doesn't matter anymore. I'm stuck with this word instead of the other one and now I have to find a way
				to survive even though this wasn't what I wanted. I'm going to make this sentence structure work, and manipulate these orange words to my advantage.
				Because I'm fucking good at this. As long as I'm out there expressing myself, that's a win for me.</p>
				<p>It's a win if we realize Senator Sanders (I-VT) is still fighting for us. Fighting for the people at the bottom of the capitalistic barrel, myself
				included. It's a win if we pull our weight, too. We can't expect him to do all the work for us. He's got too much political ignorance to deal with already, 
				like Betsy DeVos. We are the people and we are stronger than the 1% <i>combined</i>. All we have to do is fight, even if you're scare, like me. Just 
				don't let the fear consume you. I know you've got the strength in you, 99%. It's a win if we stop memes comparing our future lives under Trump's 
				presidency to life in <i>The Hunger Games</i>. We're not even at that point and you're already surrendering? You've got to fight against the terrified crowd, you've got to swim up the stream 
				and against the tide. As much as change hurts, we've got to press on. One step at a time and at our own pace. I realize that I can't be the same meek, 
				shaky, and emotionless robot I was in 2016. It's already a win that I'm being more outspoken than I was before. Last year, I didn't even have the 
				courage to make this website happen. But here I am, with the voice and strength to openly say I still support Bernie Sanders. And women. And the poor, the
				teens who face suspension for standing up for themselves, the LGBT groups, the weathly aware of their privilege and have become real active allies, the sex
				workers who are in fact <i>more</i> human than the rest of us, the people making an effort to improve their lives at any age, the people willing to learn
				and challenge their beliefs. I support the people threatened by Donald Trump's promised policies that will negatively impact their lives.</p>
				
				<p>To everyone out there, you have
				my support. I can't go to the Women's March on Washington DC because I couldn't afford to go. I fight so one day, I can be more active in the ongoing civil 
				rights movement. So I won't have to sit back second-guessing what I <i>could</i> have done.</p>
				<p>To everyone against Donald, take care of yourselves. Be wise and look out for each other. This message below is for you. I love you all so much.</p>
