   <h2>OK, moving on to personal stats</h2>
   <h4>Origin: United States</h4>

   <h4>Hair color: Brown</h4>

   <h4>Height: 165cm (5' 5")</h4>
   <h4>Zodiac sign: Libra</h4>
   <h3>Have you had any jobs?</h3>
   <p>Yes. Like most of us, I wasn't born a trust fund baby or with a silver spoon in my mouth and 
     if I was, I wouldn't be grateful for everything I have, including my parents who worked hard their whole lives to 
     establish a good life in the United States and made sure their kids did, too. For jobs, I've been a shoe shine girl, 
     call center rep, warehouse worker, dishwasher, a field worker, security guard and I packed pineapples one point in time.
     I'm currently working on coding better and becoming a registered nurse, specializing in reproductive health.</p> 
   <h3>Places I've been</h3>
   <p><b>In the United States:</b> Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, New Mexico,
     and Missouri.</p>
   <p><b>Across the world:</b> Shannon Airport, Ireland, Leipzig, Germany, Kuwait, Al Fallujah, Tallil (Imam Ali) AFB, Nasrah, Nasiriyah, 
     and Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
   <h3>Places I would <i>like</i> to go</h3>
    <p>Back to Germany, this time longer than 8 hours, Iraq, too. Mexico with a trusted group of friends, Japan, Iceland, Hungary, 
      and Alaska.</p>
   <h3>Favorite cuisines</h3>
    <p>The food of my culture, MEXICAN!!! Central/South American dishes are also amazing. The same goes for Thai, Indian, Chinese, 
      Japanese, and I wouldn't say no to trying new dishes, unless it has meat like beef and pork.</p>
   <h3> Favorite foods</h3>
   <p>Fruit, especially fruit cups doused in lime juice and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj%C3%ADn_(seasoning)">tajin</a>, coconut paletas, the list will be shorter if I listed all
     the foods I <i>don't</i> like.</p>
   <h3> Least favorite foods</h3>
    <p>Caramel, pork (yes, even bacon. I'm a monster, I know), most salad dressings except raspberry vinegrette, green apples, vodka,
      tequila, American cheese, bland food, cow's milk.
   <h3>Greatest pet peeve</h3>
    <p>When someone asks me, "Are you new here?" or any variation of that question. In my experience, that has been a lowkey term used
      by people looking to take advantage of you. They're testing out the waters to see if you can be played like a fool.
