<h2>Do you mind telling the world about yourself?</h2>
<p>Gladly. I will let you know that I am a very welcoming and artistic person, though far from being a pushover, which comes 
  to a surprise for a lot of people as I present myself to very calm. Former clients have described me as level-headed and 
  highly supportive, even during stressful situations. Since clutter makes me feel lost and nervous, I have a habit of breaking 
  this question down even further to answer with more ease. I usually engage with...</p>
<h3>"What would you like to know?"</h3>
   
<h3>About coding</h3>
<p>I absolutely love it! Starting in July 2015, I taught myself the basics of building a website using HTML/CSS, proofreading 
my work on Notepad++ and the local host, and then launching it independently on Github and utilizing the command line. My sources
for self-education are Codecademy, TechnicalCafe, Github, and w3schools. My ambition for learning more computer languages such
as Python, RubyGems, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL is still ongoing as I have already begun familiarizing myself with PHP, a language
used in making Facebook!</p>

<h3>About Art</h3>
<p>The only institutional training I received was from one semester of art class in high school. The rest of my skills were formed 
after watching my father show my siblings and I some sketches he did of comic book characters, which turned into all of us, my dad
included, drawing on sheets of lined notebook paper. I saw the lines he drew turn into realistic-looking fingers, arms, legs, a head, 
and eventually a sketch of a man posed dynamically, as seen on superheroes. His drawings were so beautiful and life-like, it was the 
prettiest thing 5-year-old me had ever seen. From there on, I wanted to draw, too. It's a nice escape when life gets too overwhelming 
and stressful. Art is my life and I'm incredibly grateful for ability and willpower to draw. I wasn't born knowing how to draw, but 
I got there with a lifetime of practice done during my free time, continuously perfecting the skill I'm looking for, which is, to 
this day, comic book style. A combination of the art styles found in Naruto and El Eternauta. </p>

<h3>About Practical Skills</h3>
<p>I genuinely enjoy guiding people through instructions and helping them find the right path if they are ever lost or have trouble
understanding something. Even if we don't speak the same language. I also like being in the spotlight, on stage, both metaphorically 
and literally, speaking in front of people and putting my best foot forward, despite also being an introvert. Is there anyone who is 
conspicuous enough to stand out when someone walks through the door asking for help? The one who sees them, walks around the corner
of her desk to approach the curious asker? That person is usually me. Sometimes, it's a curse but it's who I am and I own it. Just 
like I own the fact that I love learning new languages and have the enthusiastic curve to keep going, whether human or computer. As
long as we're alive, there's never a chance to stop learning and improving.</p>
