  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </div>
<div class="mydiv2">
  <h2>Welcome to rosieilene.com. It's so boring, it's exciting!</h2>
</div>
  
<div class="intro">
  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
   <p>I am a U.S. Army veteran who mostly stays quiet about her time in service, even when I'm asked. 
    I was in for six years from 2005-2011 and served one tour in Iraq from 2008-2009. Am I proud of my service? 
    No, not really. I'm proud to admit that didn't do anything noble or heroic, everything was mundane. We had/have 
    more in common with the Iraq civilains than with the money-hungry warlords in power who sent us over to the desert 
    in the first place. Since moving on from all the "hero" lies I was fed but refused to eat and digest, I've been exploring
    just about everything life has to offer as I still adjust to life back in the civilian world. This includes speaking out
    against The United States being in Iraq in the first place. Hey, if I'm going to be tossed aside and ignored by the same 
    war machine that used me as a nameless, faceless pawn, I may as well denounce loyalty to a system who was never loyal 
    to its soldiers in the first place. Now, I'm coping with everything by being an art and comic enthusiast, a loud-mouth, 
    amateur coder, exercise beast, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rosieilene/">instagram</a> freak.</p>

   <h3>Have you had any jobs?</h3>
   <p>Yes. Like most of us, I wasn't born a trust fund baby or with a silver spoon in my mouth and 
     if I was, I wouldn't be grateful for everything I have, including my parents who worked hard their whole lives to 
     establish a good life in the United States and made sure their kids did, too. For jobs, I've been a shoe shine girl, 
     call center rep, warehouse worker, dishwasher, a field worker, security guard and I packed pineapples one point in time.
     I'm currently working on coding better and becoming a registered nurse, specializing in reproductive health.</p> 
   <h3>Places I've been</h3>
   <p><b>In the United States:</b> Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, New Mexico,
     and Missouri.</p>
   <p><b>Across the world:</b> Shannon Airport, Ireland, Leipzig, Germany, Kuwait, Al Fallujah, Tallil (Imam Ali) AFB, Nasrah, Nasiriyah, 
     and Baghdad, Iraq.</p>
   <h3>Places I would <i>like</i> to go</h3>
    <p>Back to Germany, this time longer than 8 hours, Iraq, too. Mexico with a trusted group of friends, Japan, Iceland, Hungary, 
      and Alaska.</p>
   <h3>Favorite cuisines</h3>
    <p>The food of my culture, MEXICAN!!! Central/South American dishes are also amazing. The same goes for Thai, Indian, Chinese, 
      Japanese, and I wouldn't say no to trying new dishes, unless it has meat like beef and pork.</p>
   <h3> Favorite foods</h3>
   <p>Fruit, especially fruit cups doused in lime juice and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj%C3%ADn_(seasoning)">tajin</a>, coconut paletas, the list will be shorter if I listed all
     the foods I <i>don't</i> like.</p>
   <h3> Least favorite foods</h3>
    <p>Caramel, pork (yes, even bacon. I'm a monster, I know), most salad dressings except raspberry vinegrette, green apples, vodka,
      tequila, American cheese, bland food, cow's milk.
   <h3>Greatest pet peeve</h3>
    <p>When someone asks me, "Are you new here?" or any variation of that question. In my experience, that has been a lowkey term used
      by people looking to take advantage of you. They're testing out the waters to see if you can be played like a fool.
