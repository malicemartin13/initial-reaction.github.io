<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>Welcome to rosieilene.com. I'm proudly hosted with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.</h2>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
   <p>I am a U.S. Army veteran who mostly stays quiet about her time in service, even when I'm asked. 
    I was in for six years from 2005-2011 and served one tour in Iraq from 2008-2009. Am I proud of my service? 
    No, not really. I'm proud to admit that didn't do anything noble or heroic, everything was mundane. We had/have 
    more in common with the Iraq civilains than with the money-hungry warlords in power who sent us over to the desert 
    in the first place. Since moving on from all the "hero" lies I was fed but refused to eat and digest, I've been exploring
    just about everything life has to offer as I still adjust to life back in the civilian world. This includes speaking out
    against The United States being in Iraq in the first place. Hey, if I'm going to be tossed aside and ignored by the same 
    war machine that used me as a nameless, faceless pawn, I may as well denounce loyalty to a system who was never loyal 
    to its soldiers in the first place. Now, I'm coping with everything by being an art and comic enthusiast, a loud-mouth, 
    amateur coder, exercise beast, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rosieilene/">instagram</a> freak.</p>

 <h2>What will you find here?</h2>
 <p>Do you have time to kill before you have to go off and do something important? Here you'll find endless content that'll 
  keep you here for hours, stories, comics, blogs, pictures, and other mundane things, some of it NSFW. Pretty soon my 
  twin site, <a href="http://www.malicealicemartin.com/">malicealicemartin.com</a>, will be joining us, too.</p>
